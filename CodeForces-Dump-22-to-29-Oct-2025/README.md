So this is my work submission at CodeForces from Oct 5 to Oct 13 2025.

Operating program instruction:
1. Compiling (use minGW64 or others supported compiler)
```bash
    - for C:
gcc <file-name>.c -o <file-name>.exe
```
```bash
    - for C++:
gcc <file-name>.cpp -o <file-name>.exe
```
2. Running the program
```bash
.\<file-name>.exe
```

For CPH Judge:
1. Install CPH judge extensions
```txt
divyanshuagrawal.competitive-programming-helper
```
2. Download .cph folders. IT MUST BE in the SAME DIRECTORIES with the source code.
